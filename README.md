# fillit
ðŸ§©A space optimization algorithm using tetraminos

Fillit is a program which finds the smallest space in where a number of tetraminos can fit.

To test this program simply make to create the executable and then do:

./fillit tests/basic

  to make a test with only two tetraminos.
 
./fillit tests/medium

  to make a test with eight tetraminos.
  
 ./fillit tests/hard
 
  to make a test with all the possible tetraminos (19). This test takes three minutes.
  
Fillit is the fourth project in Codam, the evaluation required that our algorithm was fast, and to make it faster, we made it without recursion.
